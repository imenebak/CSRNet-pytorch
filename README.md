# CSRNet-pytorch

This is the PyTorch version repo for [CSRNet: Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks for Understanding the Highly Congested Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.10062) in CVPR 2018, which delivered a state-of-the-art, straightforward and end-to-end architecture for crowd counting tasks.

## Datasets
CC visdrone Dataset: [web_site](http://aiskyeye.com/)

## Prerequisites
We strongly recommend Anaconda or Google Colab as the environment.

Python: 3.6

CUDA: 10.1

## Training and validation Process

Follow the `CSRNet_PyTorch.ipynb` to try the validation. You can try to modify the notebook and see the output of each image.
